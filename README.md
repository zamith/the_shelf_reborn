# TheShelf

To start your new Phoenix application you have to:

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Start Phoenix router with `mix phoenix.start`
3. Run the migrations with `mix ecto.migrate Repo`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.

## Setup the database

1. Install postgres and open psql
2. Insert the following commands:

```
create user phoenix with password 'phoenix';
create database the_shelf owner phoenix;
grant all privileges on database the_shelf to phoenix;
```

## Insert dummy data

1. Open iex with the project loaded with `iex -S mix`
2. Create a book with `book = %Book{title: "Something"}`
3. Insert it into the database with `Repo.insert(book)`

## Running tests

1. Install PhantomJS
2. Run `phantomjs --webdriver=8910` and `mix phoenix.start` or Install foreman and run `foreman start`
3. Run `mix test`

## Notes

* If you choose to change the application's structure, you could manually start the router from your code like this `TheShelf.Router.start`
